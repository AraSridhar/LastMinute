                        <p class="lead">Our eating habits directly determine our health.
                            In our busy schedules and fast lives, we often end up eating as per convenience, rather than what is healthy. Many a times, we eat to please our taste buds, but remain quite unaware about the health hazards that this type of eating habit might pose.
                            Every element is needed for your body, whether it is vitamins, minerals, proteins, carbohydrates, fibers or even fat (although choose the healthy ones). Each of these nutrients has their own individual roles to play in the physical and mental development.
                            Healthy eating does not mean having only boiled meals, eating less, or saying no to fat. Healthy food habits mean nutritious eating, i.e. eating everything in the right amount and right way. Don’t completely exclude fats or overdo the fibers and proteins!
                            By eating a balanced diet, we get all the nutrients that are necessary for a healthy living. These include proteins, vitamins, calcium, various minerals and above all a lot of energy that helps us in our day to day activities.
